// an appointment decline performs the following functions
// -- passes an Appointment_Offer_Response indiciating the offers are rejected selected and informs PSO to release all remaining slots
// -- deletes the 'do not schedule' activity; a cascade will delete the SLA, and Status objects
// -- passes an updated Activity_Status of 0 teelling the DSE that the activity is now schedulable
// -- deletes the appointment SLA -- because an SLA contains three primary keys, the new Activity_SLA is considered an insert rather than an upsert
